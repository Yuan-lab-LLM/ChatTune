##  4. Quick Start


**4.1  Environment Configuration**

We recommend the following Docker/Conda environment configurations:
+ Ubuntu20.04、python3.12
+ NVIDIA-SMI 535.154.05、Driver Version: 535.154.05、CUDA Version: 12.2

You can use your own environment that meets the requirements, or launch a container via the following commands:

```bash
docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/cuda:12.2.0-devel-ubuntu20.04
sudo docker run -itd --name <container_name> -v /home/<username>:/home/workspace --gpus all --ipc=host -v /root/.ssh:/root/.ssh --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE --privileged=true --ulimit stack=68719476736 --network host --shm-size=20G nvcr.io/nvidia/cuda:12.2.0-devel-ubuntu20.04 /bin/bash
```

**Code Download**

```bash
git clone -b dev https://github.com/MedFlow2025/medflow.git
```

**Dependency Installation**

Please confirm your Python version and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4.2  Service Operation**


**OpenAI Service Preparation**

You need to deploy your models in advance using tools such as [ollama](https://ollama.com/)、[fastchat](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat)、[vllm](https://vllm.hyper.ai/docs/). We will also release deployment documentation for reference in the ./docs directory.

After deployment, your OpenAI-compatible service will have a URL similar to:

```bash
http://<openai ip>:<openai port>/v1 
```

**Data Preparation (Optional)**

We offer a function to import a custom knowledge base, which includes information about diagnoses, medicines, examination forms, etc. For specific examples, please refer to the [data_preparation.md](./docs/data_preparation.md). You can run the following script:

```bash
cd data
python3 create_database.py
```

We also provide a function to customize quality inspection rules. For specific examples, please refer to the [quality_base.json](./data/raw/json/quality/quality_base.json) and [quality.json](./data/raw/json/quality/quality.json) file. The changes will take effect after you modify the file and restart the service.

**Inference Service Startup**

```bash
python3 inference.py --model <model_name> --model-url http://<openai ip>:<port>/v1 --host <server ip> --port <server port> --max-tokens 4096
```

**WebUI Interface Startup**

1. Install dependencies

   ```
   cd web
   apt-get update && apt-get install npm mkcert
   npm install --production
   ```

2. Generate CA

   The parameter `${ip}` needs to be changed to the actual IP address.

   ```
   mkcert -key-file key.pem -cert-file cert.pem ${ip}
   ```

3. Start Server

   Make sure that the inference service and the voice service have been started, and modify the `host`, `port`, `inferport` and `voiceport` parameters in the script. Then run:

   ```
   node server.js
   ```

> Note:
>
> The old interface can be launched by using the following command:
>
> ```
> python3 inference_ui.py --host <server ip> --port <server port> --gradio-port <webui port> --model <model_name>
> ```

**Real-time voice transcription**

Start the real-time speech transcription server:

```
python3 realtime_transcription.py
```

> Note: Modify parameters such as `--host`, `--model-path`, `--ssl-cert`, and `--ssl-key` according to the actual situation. For the test script, you can refer to [test-realtime_transcription.py](./tests/test-realtime_transcription.py).

**Speaker recognition**

Start the speaker recognition service:

```
python3 speaker_diarization.py
```

> Note:Modify parameters such as `--host`, `--model-path`, `--sd-model-path`, `--ssl-cert`, and `--ssl-key` according to the actual situation. For the test script, you can refer to [test-speaker_diarization.py](./tests/test-speaker_diarization.py).
